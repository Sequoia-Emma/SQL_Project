# Stress Level Analysis using SQL

This project analyzes employee stress data to identify key stress drivers, physiological patterns, and high-risk groups using SQL.

## Project Objective
To clean, transform, and analyze stress management data in order to uncover actionable insights related to:
- Stress sources
- Stress severity
- Heart rate and cortisol patterns
- Demographic and lifestyle factors

## Tools Used
- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server – SSMS)
- Microsoft Excel (for validation and visualization)

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes employee demographics, stress sources, physical and emotional symptoms, coping mechanisms, stress duration, heart rate, cortisol levels, sleep quality, and calculated stress scores.

## Key SQL Tasks Performed
- Data cleaning (trimming whitespace, removing duplicates)
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing categorical fields
- Creating derived columns (Age, Age Group, Stress Class, Heart Rate Class, Cortisol Class)
- Stress level classification using CASE statements
- Analytical queries to support dashboard insights

## Key Insights
- Work-related stress is the leading stressor
- Over half of employees experience chronic stress
- Elevated heart rate and cortisol levels correlate with higher stress scores
- Poor sleep quality is strongly linked to severe stress
